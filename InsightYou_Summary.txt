Formula to Decide Result:

// 1️⃣ Mapping of questions to MBTI traits
const questionMap = {
    1: { A: 'E', B: 'E', C: 'I', D: 'I' }, // E/I
    2: { A: 'S', B: 'S', C: 'N', D: 'N' }, // S/N
    3: { A: 'T', B: 'T', C: 'F', D: 'F' }, // T/F
    4: { A: 'J', B: 'J', C: 'P', D: 'P' }, // J/P
    5: { A: 'E', B: 'E', C: 'I', D: 'I' }, // E/I
    6: { A: 'S', B: 'S', C: 'N', D: 'N' }, // S/N
    7: { A: 'T', B: 'T', C: 'F', D: 'F' }, // T/F
    8: { A: 'J', B: 'J', C: 'P', D: 'P' }, // J/P
    9: { A: 'E', B: 'E', C: 'I', D: 'I' }, // E/I
    10:{ A: 'S', B: 'S', C: 'N', D: 'N' }  // S/N
};

// 2️⃣ Initialize counters
let scores = { E: 0, I: 0, S: 0, N: 0, T: 0, F: 0, J: 0, P: 0 };

// Example: user's answers array (index = question number - 1)
// Each element is 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'
let userAnswers = ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'A', 'C', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'D'];

// 3️⃣ Count answers
userAnswers.forEach((answer, index) => {
    let qNum = index + 1;
    let trait = questionMap[qNum][answer];
    scores[trait] += 1;
});

// 4️⃣ Determine MBTI letters
let letter1 = scores.E >= scores.I ? 'E' : 'I';
let letter2 = scores.S >= scores.N ? 'S' : 'N';
let letter3 = scores.T >= scores.F ? 'T' : 'F';
let letter4 = scores.J >= scores.P ? 'J' : 'P';

// 5️⃣ Combine MBTI type
let mbtiResult = letter1 + letter2 + letter3 + letter4;

// 6️⃣ Output result
console.log("Your MBTI type is:", mbtiResult);
